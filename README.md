# Assignment 5 #

## Task 1 ##
In this task I have created a dictionary in py with sample student names and marks. Using a simple if-else statement we check if a student is in the dictionary
and print their marks. If the student doesn't exist then a message saying that the student was not found is displayed

## Task 2 ##
In this task I have written a py code to list numbers from 1 to 10. Using the list slice function I extracted the first five numbers to a seperate list. Using the list reversal
on the extracted list I created a third list of reversed extracted numbers and then printed all three lists.
